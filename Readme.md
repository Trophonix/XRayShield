It can be very fun and rewarding to own a Minecraft server. The community you can foster is a beautiful thing. However, as a server owner, there are a few frustrations you run into. One of the bigger thorns in your side can often be [B]hackers[/B].

People who use modified clients or x-ray texture packs to gain an advantage over others. This makes things unfair for your legitimate players and can upset the economy if it goes far enough. X-Ray Shield is a [B]simple [/B]tool that aims to help you fix this problem.

X-Ray Shield helps you catch x-rayers by notifying you of abnormal mining patterns. For example, someone mining 20 diamonds in a period of 5 minutes. Here are some features and perks of X-Ray Shield that will help you decide whether to pick it up for your server:[/CENTER]

[LIST]

[*][B]Plug-and-play: [/B]X-Ray Shield comes preloaded with tested configurations, so you can just install and start right up!

[*]Doesn't count ores/blocks placed by the player

[*]Completely [B]configurable[/B] - you can add/remove blocks counted as ores, change the times and amounts of each one

[*]All messages sent to players by the plugin can be changed! So X-Ray Shield will fit in perfectly with your chat formatting and style. This also means it can be used in any language - just have to change the message configurations!

I aim to make my plugins easy to setup and use, and X-Ray Shield is no exception. There aren't any commands at this time (though some will be added in the next couple versions). The only thing you have to do to start using X-Ray Shield is give your staff ranks a simple permission:

[B]xrayshield.alert - [/B]Players with this permission will receive the alerts of potential x-rayers

You can configure X-Ray Shield's functions and messages through it's configuration file, located at plugins/XRayShield/config.yml
